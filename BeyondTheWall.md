<p>Civil Integration Exams is the most confusing part. It seems under <strong><code>highly skilled migrant</code></strong> and  <strong><code>immigrants with residence permit based on employment</code></strong> category , one doesn’t need to go through Civil Integration Exams in order to obtain a residence/work permit.<br>
<code>Not every immigrant is required to fulfil the civic integration obligation. For example, highly skilled migrants, entrepreneurs and immigrants with a residence permit based on employment are exempt from the obligation to pass the civic integration exam. Their family members who have a dependent permit are not required to take the exam either.</code></p>
<p>One can apply for Citizenship after 5 years.<br>
Relevant Netherland work permits type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intracorporate transfer (Transfer to another international corporate team in NL, for example)</li>
<li>Highly skilled migrant</li>
<li>EU Blue Card: To achieve this, <strong>salary</strong> should reach €5272 gross per month</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-1-get-the-right-permit">Step 1: Get the right permit</h3>
<p>One needs to make sure the permit is <strong>The Critical Skills Employment Permit</strong>.<br>
This permit is valid for 2 years and after that one can apply for Stamp 4 in order to live/work in Ireland without employment permit.<br>
<em><strong>How to count the duration of stay:</strong></em><br>
<code>Be aware that your time spent living legally in Ireland is not based on dates of your visa or employment permits, it’s based on when you register with Immigration. This means it’s very important that you do this as soon as possible after arriving as delays in registering can cause serious complications when applying for residency or further permits/visas.</code></p>
